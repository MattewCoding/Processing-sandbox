# Processing Sandbox
This project is a modified program of one of the example programs given on Processing's website. I'm new to Processing, so this is just me trying to figure out the different commands and controls.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Processing installed on your machine. You can download it from Processing.org.

### Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/processing-sandbox.git
```

Open the project in Processing by double-clicking the .pde file or navigating to "File > Open" within the Processing IDE.

## Running the Program

Once you have the project open in Processing, simply click the "Run" button (a play icon) in the top-left corner of the Processing IDE. This will compile and execute the program, launching a window displaying the visual output.
